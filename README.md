## Hi there and welcome to my GitHub! 👋

#### ✨ My name is Marco Antônio Cunha and I'm a Automation Test Engineer, Software Engineer in Test, QA, or whatever name people give nowadays for a guy who loves Software Testing and creates automated tests.

#### 😄 I use this GitHub for personal purposes and also for job interviews.

#### ⚡ For a more complete respository, with a lot of examples, codes and reviews about Software Testing, please go to my "Organization": [*BugTrio*](https://github.com/bugtrio/). They're also mine, but I share them with some friends and our community.

#### 📫 If you want to talk about any code or just share any suggestions, use this to find me at [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" />](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcoantjr/)
