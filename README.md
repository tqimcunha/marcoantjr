## Hi there and welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ My name is Marco AntÃ´nio Cunha and I'm a Automation Test Engineer, Software Engineer in Test, QA, or whatever name people give nowadays for a guy who loves Software Testing and creates automated tests.

ðŸ˜„ I use this GitHub for personal purposes and also for job interviews.

âš¡ For a more complete respository, with a lot of examples, codes and reviews about Software Testing, please go to my "Organization": [*BugTrio*](https://github.com/bugtrio/). They're also mine, but I share with some friends and community.
